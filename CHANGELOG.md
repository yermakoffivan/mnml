# Changelog

All notable changes to **mnml** are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Day-to-day development history lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (the Status
block); this file is the curated, user-facing summary.

**0.2.22 is the final Rust release.** The project continues as mnml 0.3,
a new codebase written in Zig, at this same repository; run
`mnml export-config-zon` from 0.2.22 before upgrading. See the notice at
the top of the [README](README.md).

- file the context_menu truncation found while auditing
- drop the scratch TODO.md scan probe

### Added

- *(config)* `mnml export-config-zon [--out PATH] [--workspace DIR] [--in PATH] [--force]`
  converts a 0.2.x `config.toml` to the `config.zon` mnml 0.3 (mnml-zig) reads —
  only the keys you set, a `//` doc comment per key, closed-set strings as enum
  literals, `[[marketplace.source]]` as a tagged union, formatter/linter
  string-or-list as a list, and anything it cannot place kept verbatim in a
  trailing `// unmigrated:` block. The TOML file is left where it was.

### Fixed

- *(vim)* `guu` / `gUU` / `g~~` leave the cursor on the line they changed
  (`3G3|g~~` ends at 3:1, on the first non-blank) instead of dropping to
  the start of the next line, so `j .` repeats on the next line rather
  than the one after; the count form (`3guu`) now covers three lines and
  keeps the cursor where it was, as vim does.
- *(editor)* Saving a file with no final newline no longer moves the cursor:
  the appended `\n` used to park it on a phantom line below the last one
  (`Ln 2/1`), so a vim `A` / `o` from there edited the wrong place. Cursor,
  selection and sticky column all stay put; a vim Normal cursor sitting past
  the last character steps back onto it. And vim's Esc from Insert or Replace
  now stops at the start of the line (`:help i_<Esc>`) instead of crossing
  onto the line above — `o<Esc>` stays on the opened line, `i<Esc>` at
  column 0 stays put, `A<Esc>` lands on the last character.

## [0.2.21](https://github.com/chris-mclennan/mnml/compare/mnml-rs-v0.2.20...mnml-rs-v0.2.21) - 2026-09-01

### Added

- *(markdown)* typing on a rendered preview swaps to the editor
- *(md)* rendered-first stays the default, but becomes an option
- *(files)* a "Delete permanently" button on the confirm modal
- *(files)* Option on the delete confirm skips the trash
- *(files)* a trash view, and widen the panel gutter to 3 cells
- *(files)* a delete is undoable — it moves to the workspace trash
- *(editor)* the breadcrumb is clickable

### Fixed

- *(ui)* FINDINGS gets a cursor; panel caches refresh on fs changes
- *(ui)* the TODOS/NOTES gutter never painted its accent bar
- *(#1238)* markdown preview tabs carry no marker glyph at all
- *(#1238)* .http had the preview bug in both directions
- *(#1238)* glancing at an image left a permanent tab, same as markdown
- *(md)* a markdown preview was always a permanent tab
- *(files)* migrate the old trash index; say "Delete permanently" in there
- *(files)* deleting inside the trash re-trashed it; hide the index
- *(picker)* "Open file" ignored a pasted path, silently
- *(ui)* hide the terminal caret while a dropdown is open
- *(files)* bound the trash by size, and verify the symlink case
- *(files)* two ways the undoable delete still destroyed data
- *(test)* Windows path separator broke the TODO-prompt assertion
- *(git)* the repo chip was a dead end once you closed your repo tabs

### Other

- rename crates/fim-engine/ -> crates/mnml-fim-engine/
- *(v0.2.20)* the file-manager release

## [0.2.20](https://github.com/chris-mclennan/mnml/compare/mnml-rs-v0.2.19...mnml-rs-v0.2.20) - 2026-08-31

A file manager, background file operations, and three separate editor
freezes fixed. The performance work matters most if you open large
files: mnml could lock up for minutes on a minified JSON file or on a
13,000-line source file, and both are now fast.

### Added

- **Files pane** — a directory listing as a first-class pane
  (`files.open`), so a file browser is just another thing you can split,
  tab, and arrange. Navigation, sort, hidden-file toggle, a clickable
  breadcrumb with a destinations picker (Home / Downloads / volumes /
  workspaces / recents), git status badges per row, and `p` to preview
  a file without leaving the listing.
- **Multi-select** in that pane. `Space` marks, `a` marks all, `Esc`
  clears; every operation acts on the set. Reachable by mouse too —
  Ctrl/Cmd-click toggles one, Shift-click extends a range, and the
  right-click menu acts on the marked set rather than silently on the
  row under the cursor.
- **Dual file panes** (commander layout) from the `+` menu.
- **Background file transfers.** Copy and move run off the render
  thread, so a large directory can no longer freeze the editor. A
  statusline chip shows progress and speed while one is running, hidden
  entirely when nothing is; `transfer.cancel_all` in the palette.
- **Notification history.** Every message already recorded to
  `:messages` now persists per workspace and survives a restart, with a
  statusline badge counting unread warnings and errors. Info does not
  light it.
- **Submenus** in context menus, and the `+` menu regrouped from ~15
  flat rows into five. Each row carries a kebab for pinning, hiding, or
  copying its command id, and your layout persists.
- **TODO actions.** The TODOs panel offers to hand a marker to an AI
  session, listing whatever agents, commands, and skills the workspace's
  own `.claude/` directory contains, and falling back to plain Claude
  Code or Codex when it has none.
- `--no-session` (also `./run.sh fresh`) launches without restoring the
  previous session — an escape hatch for the case where a restored pane
  wedges the app and relaunching reopens it.

### Fixed

- **Three editor freezes on large files.** A single very long line (a
  minified 545 KB JSON file on one line) made the renderer redo
  whole-line work for every visual row. Separately, line lookups scanned
  the entire buffer on every call, and the statusline breadcrumb ran a
  regex pass over the whole file every frame. On a 13,000-line file,
  frame time went from 300 ms to 9 ms.
- **Horizontal scrolling rendered nothing.** With line wrap off, the
  view window never moved, so anything past the viewport width on a long
  line was unreachable and the cursor drifted off the character it was
  on. Long-standing; found while reviewing the performance work.
- **`PageDown` on a short file** parked the cursor past the end and
  painted a blank pane.
- Scroll acceleration is calibrated for terminals that multiply wheel
  events, and defaults to a sane setting.
- Git panel: the rail scrolls, tags list newest first, a collapsed
  section's count no longer changes as you scroll past it, and clicking
  a branch reveals its commit with context instead of pinned to a screen
  edge.
- The `+ dock` chip no longer paints over the bottom-right pane's last
  row, where clicking a file created a sticky note. Its actions moved
  into the `+` menu.
- A menu left open no longer keeps the keyboard after a Ctrl+punctuation
  chord.

### Security

- Hardened the GitHub Actions workflows: event-supplied values reach
  shell steps as environment variables rather than being interpolated
  into the script, and every workflow declares least-privilege
  permissions. Both classes were reported by code scanning.


## [0.2.19](https://github.com/chris-mclennan/mnml/compare/mnml-rs-v0.2.17...mnml-rs-v0.2.19) - 2026-08-27

Security release. Everything below came out of an audit of the
credential, untrusted-input, and network surfaces; upgrading is
worthwhile even though none of it is remotely exploitable.

The two changes most likely to be noticed day to day: opening a repo
that ships its own `.mnml/` config now asks before running anything
from it, and AI ghost text is off unless you turned it on.

### Added

- **Workspace trust.** A workspace's own `.mnml/` config could name programs
  mnml would then run — a language server, a formatter, a startup command, an
  integration — which meant cloning a repo and opening it in mnml could execute
  code from that repo with no prompt. mnml now scans for those keys on open and
  asks first.

  You'll see the dialog only when a workspace actually declares something
  executable; an ordinary repo never prompts. It lists the real commands and
  when each would fire, and defaults to "Don't trust". Declining is
  non-destructive — only the executable keys are ignored, so the same config's
  theme and keymaps still apply and your global language servers and formatters
  keep working, with a `RESTRICTED` chip explaining why anything is off.

  Trust is remembered per workspace and fingerprinted, so approving one today
  doesn't bless what a later `git pull` adds. `workspace.review_trust` reviews
  or revokes; decisions live in `~/.config/mnml/trusted_workspaces.toml`.

  **You'll likely be asked once for workspaces you already use** — anything with
  a `.mnml/integrations/` manifest or custom `[lsp.*]` block. That's expected;
  trust it once and it stays trusted.

### Changed

- **AI ghost-text is off by default again.** 0.2.16 (task #974) turned
  inline suggestions on for anyone who hadn't explicitly set
  `[ai] inline_suggestions`. Ghost text sends buffer context around
  your cursor to a remote backend, so an absent setting shouldn't have
  stood in for consent — and three groups had never actually been
  asked: anyone who picked the first-launch wizard's "Skip for now",
  anyone who dismissed it with Esc, and anyone who completed the wizard
  before it had an AI section at all.

  **If you set `inline_suggestions = true` yourself, nothing changes.**
  If you were relying on the 0.2.16 default, re-enable via
  `ai.setup_suggestions`, Settings → AI, or `[ai] inline_suggestions =
  true`. A one-time tip after your first save points the way.

- **The screen dump is off by default.** mnml wrote a verbatim copy of
  the rendered UI to `<workspace>/.mnml/ipc/screen.txt` about ten times
  a second, in normal terminal use, not just headless. Nothing
  user-facing ever read it — only mnml's own development tooling does —
  so it now ships off. Set `[ipc] write_screen = true` if you drive
  mnml from a script or an agent. Headless mode is unaffected.

### Fixed

- **First-launch wizard: "Skip for now" now actually skips.** It wrote
  no setting, so the on-by-default took over and declining the feature
  silently enabled it. Skip and Esc now leave ghost text off, and Skip
  records the decision so a future default change can't override it.
- **Secrets files are never sent to a remote ghost-text backend.**
  Files whose names look secret-bearing — `.env`, `id_rsa`, `*.pem`,
  `*.key`, `*credentials*`, `.netrc`, `.npmrc`, and similar — are
  skipped regardless of your settings. Opting into completions isn't
  opting into uploading your AWS credentials. The local FIM backend is
  unaffected; nothing leaves the machine there.
- **Credential files are owner-only (0600).** Integration tokens and
  their timestamped backups, the cookie jar, HTTP request history,
  captured browser traffic, agent transcript exports, saved auth
  presets, `.env` values written from the HTTP pane, and the IPC files
  all went to disk at the process umask — world-readable on a stock
  macOS or Linux box. Existing files are tightened in place, so this
  applies to what you already have, not only to new writes.
- **HTTP history no longer records resolved credentials.** Headers were
  template-expanded before logging, so an auth header written as a
  `{{VAR}}` reference was recorded with the variable already resolved —
  the real token, into the workspace log *and* a
  global cross-workspace one. Sensitive headers now persist the
  unexpanded `{{VAR}}` form, which keeps history entries replayable
  without storing the secret; a hard-coded literal is redacted instead.
  Request bodies get the same treatment, plus scrubbing of well-known
  credential fields (`password`, `client_secret`, …).
- **`.rqst/` is added to `.gitignore` automatically.** It holds request
  history, captured traffic and environment values, and only `.mnml/`
  was being ignored — so `git add -A` could stage credentials. Your
  `.curl` / `.http` / `.rest` request files are deliberately left
  tracked; they reference secrets through `{{VAR}}` rather than
  embedding them.
- **A repo can no longer overwrite files outside itself through the IPC
  channel.** The four `.mnml/ipc/` files were written without a symlink
  check, and git preserves symlinks — so a cloned repo could point one
  at a file in your home directory and have mnml truncate it. mnml now
  replaces a symlinked IPC file with a regular one, and refuses to
  rewrite a symlinked `.gitignore` at all.
- **Tools no longer receive credentials they have no use for.** Every
  integration's stored tokens were injected into any process launched
  from a chip — including `htop`, `btop`, `ncdu`, `lazygit`, `gh` and
  `dust`, which carry an integration id only so their tab shows the
  right glyph. An integration now receives another's token only if it
  declares `[[auth]]` of its own. Shell exports are unaffected.
- **The Sonos audio stream is no longer open to the network.** While
  streaming this Mac's audio to a speaker, the server bound every
  interface and served anyone who connected — a live feed of your
  system output, call audio included. It now binds only the
  player-facing interface and accepts only the player itself. Grouped
  rooms are unaffected.
- **Cookies are attributed to the host that actually set them.** After a
  redirect, a `Set-Cookie` from the destination was filed under the
  originally-requested host and replayed there, sending one site a
  session cookie issued by another.
- **Windows: opening a URL can't run a command.** The external-URL
  opener shelled out through `cmd`, which re-parses its own
  metacharacters, so a crafted link could start a second command. It
  now hands the URL to `explorer.exe`, and non-http(s) or
  quote-bearing URLs are refused outright.
- **`workspace.review_trust` reviews instead of revoking.** On an
  already-trusted workspace it used to revoke immediately, with no
  dialog and no confirmation. It now shows what was approved, with
  `Revoke` / `Keep trusted`.

## [0.2.17](https://github.com/chris-mclennan/mnml/compare/mnml-rs-v0.2.16...mnml-rs-v0.2.17) - 2026-08-24

Tree polish release. Iterative visual refinement of the file
tree's connector + chevron system plus a workspace-header
cleanup.

### Added

- **nvim-tree-style tree connectors** (#1201). Every child row
  now carries a `│` line back to its parent, with the last child
  in a directory getting the `└` corner. Rendered in `bg2` (a
  step below `comment`) so they read as background trace marks;
  chevrons paint at the same weight for a uniform look.
- **Custom-baked connectors at F1F04 / F1F05** — a shifted
  `│`/`└` pair injected into `MnmlSymbols.ttf` by
  `scripts/inject_tree_connectors.py`. Sits closer to the parent
  folder-icon column above than plain U+2502/U+2514, and the L's
  arm is tuned to visually match the vertical bar (CoreText was
  rasterising the two at different weights).
- **`+ New session` action-chip constants** and search-glyph
  consolidation — every activity-panel action chip now shares
  the same visual + interaction shape (#1195, #1200).

### Changed

- **Workspace header shows `~/Projects/mnml/`** instead of a
  bare `mnml`, so the active repo's location is visible at a
  glance. Depth 1 rows shift 2 cells right so nested children
  align under the parent's folder icon.
- **Tree header icon cluster right-aligned** — file/folder/pull/
  collapse-all chips flush to the panel's right edge; refresh
  glyph reserved to the top-right corner above the scrollbar
  (#1021).
- **Cursor-row connector fg lifts to `bg3`** so the trace lines
  stay visible over the highlight background instead of
  vanishing.

### Removed

- **Workspace up-nav (↑) chip + `.. Projects` row**. The
  `view.workspace_up` command, the `App::navigate_workspace_up`
  method, the `tree_up_row` rect, and the `HoverChip::TreeUpRow`
  variant are all gone — if a user wants another directory, they
  add it as a workspace. Thorough cleanup across 10 sites
  (command registry, hover-help, click handlers, IPC rects dump,
  InfoViewCopy, dispatch).

## [0.2.16](https://github.com/chris-mclennan/mnml/compare/mnml-rs-v0.2.15...mnml-rs-v0.2.16) - 2026-08-23

Tester-round release. Two rounds of persona-driven bug hunts
(R10 nvchad-user / vscode-keyboard / api-workflow, then R11 of
each) turned up two SEV-1 stability bugs plus a wide field of
vim-fidelity + keyboard-completeness gaps. All fixed, most
with regression-lock tests.

### Fixed

- **Multi-cursor + `/search` + insert no longer panics**
  (#1149, `73618036`). `clear_find_and_deselect` had cleared
  `extra_cursors` but not `extra_anchors`, tripping a
  debug_assert (and silently desyncing in release) on the very
  next multi-cursor motion — the exact recovery gesture a user
  would try after a `/search` on multi-cursor state. Both vecs
  now clear together via `Editor::clear_extra_cursors()`.
- **`<leader>n` / `[ui] line_numbers = false` actually hides
  the digits** (#1149, `73618036` + `98c753ee`). The renderer
  was emitting `format!("{:>0} ", n+1)` which still produces
  the digit at width 0. Guard the branch, and while
  auditing, also fix the wrapped-continuation glyph's
  gutter-width invariant for the same `num_w == 0` case so
  wrapped rows align with straight rows when line numbers
  are off.
- **`Shift+Tab` (both terminal forms) walks buffers
  backward** (#1149, `73618036` + `35d6a805`). Some terminals
  send `Shift+Tab` as `Tab + SHIFT` rather than `BackTab`;
  bare `Tab if !ctrl` was catching that and running
  `buffer.next` (the opposite direction). Explicit `Tab if
  SHIFT` arm added, ordered before the ctrl arm.
  `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` now also lands on `buffer.prev` in both
  vim and standard modes (VS Code muscle memory) — the
  standard-mode binding was silently falling through to the
  editor and inserting a literal `\t`.
- **`<leader>?` cheatsheet Esc actually closes the pane**
  (#1149, `73618036`). Was just refocusing off the pane
  (which stayed open). NvChad's `<leader>?` is a floating
  window that Esc dismisses; a Cheatsheet pane with no undo
  state is safe to close on Esc.
- **`Y` on empty line no longer captures `\n`** (#1153, three
  commits). NvChad's `Y = y$` rewrite crossed the newline via
  `MoveRight` on empty lines, so `Y` then `p` split whatever
  was on the next line. Real vim `y$` on empty is a no-op —
  now matches. Same guard also fixes `d$`/`c$` on empty which
  used to delete the newline and merge lines.
- **`y` operator now preserves the cursor across every yank
  code path** (#1153, three commits). All 5 yank arms —
  generic motion, explicit `Y`, `yf<c>`/`yt<c>`, text-object
  yanks (`yiw`, `yap`, ...), and `ygn`/`ygN` — now restore
  `ctx.cursor` after `YankSelection`, matching vim's
  `y`-preserves-cursor invariant.
- **`p` no longer silently pastes stale system clipboard
  after `Y` on empty line** (#1149, `73618036`). The
  unnamed-register fallback path used to serve the OS
  clipboard whenever it differed from the empty register.
  Track `register_owned` — after any in-mnml yank/delete the
  register is authoritative; only cold-start (pre-first-yank)
  falls back to the OS. `"+p` still explicitly reads the OS
  clipboard.
- **`Ctrl+K Ctrl+S` opens keys.edit as advertised** (#1154,
  `859b8ee5`). The global `Ctrl+S` save-anywhere handler was
  shadowing the chord chain. Guard on
  `pending_chord_seq.is_empty()` so a chord in flight
  resolves through the chain instead.
- **Palette pane-scope regression fixed** (#1154, `859b8ee5`
  + `c1d2d5e9`). `priority = 1` from #1113 was a hard tier
  that always beat fuzzy score, so common queries like
  `save file` picked `lsp.diagnostics_severity_filter_cycle`
  over `file.save` (a 341-score bull's-eye). New
  `PickerItem.score_bonus: i64` field lets you nudge without
  the always-wins semantics — palette uses `+20` for pane-
  scope, `+50` for recents, restoring the documented
  "recents > pane-scoped > everything-else" invariant at
  empty query while letting a strong match elsewhere still
  win on typed queries.
- **HTTP Env chip agrees with the pane** (#1152, `56a94239`).
  Top-bar chip was using the legacy `EnvSet::select` and
  showing `none ▾` + warning-yellow when only workspace TOML
  `[http] default_env` set the active env, while the Vars
  tab / URL var-coloring / actual Send all correctly
  resolved. Threaded config_default_env down + switched to
  `select_with_config_default`.
- **Response pane copy chip copies what's on screen**
  (#1152, `56a94239`). Was hard-wired to
  `http_copy_response_body()` regardless of which sub-tab was
  active — clicking copy while viewing Headers silently
  copied the body (toast literally said "response body
  copied" while headers were on screen). Branches on
  `rp.response_tab` and routes Headers → `http_copy_response_
  headers`; Body/Timeline/Tests keep copying body.
- **HTTP no longer auto-arms its filter on entry** (#1154,
  `859b8ee5`). Entering the HTTP activity opens a Request
  pane that steals `Focus::Pane`, so typing landed in the
  URL field instead of `/` filter. HTTP's "top thing you
  type" is a URL, not a filter — leave HTTP unarmed.
- **Scratch strip title uses the actual chord** (#1155,
  `f92f5cfc`). Focused label said "\`term.scratch_toggle\`
  closes" — an internal palette command id, not a keyboard
  chord. Now reads "Ctrl+\` closes" (which is what actually
  works).

### Added

- **`<leader>fb` / `<leader>fg` fast-fire chords** (#1149,
  `4963cba9`) — picker.buffers and find.grep bound directly
  at the keymap layer, matching the `space f f` fast-fire
  precedent. No whichkey overlay wait for these daily-hit
  chords.
- **`[ui] tree_preview_on_arrow` Settings row** (#1155,
  `f92f5cfc`) — the R10 F9 knob was TOML-only; now shows up
  in Ctrl+, alongside the other UI toggles.
- **`PickerItem.score_bonus` field** (#1154, `859b8ee5`) —
  additive fuzzy-score bump for "prefer this row for ties"
  without the always-wins semantics of `priority`. Palette
  and future score-nudge use cases build on this.
- **Regression-lock tests** for the vim Tab-family arms and
  the palette score_bonus tier order (#1154, `f936dd75`).
  Both had flip-flopped across consecutive reviewer rounds;
  the tests stop a third regression.

## [0.2.15](https://github.com/chris-mclennan/mnml/compare/mnml-rs-v0.2.14...mnml-rs-v0.2.15) - 2026-08-22

Sonos + Pty-identity release, on top of a same-day 0.2.14 CI-repair
bump. Headline: **mnml now sees your Sonos household and can route
this Mac's audio to it**, either via Music.app's AirPlay picker
(cold-capable, Music.app-audio-only) or via a BlackHole → ffmpeg →
UPnP loopback stream (any app's audio). A single constant-width
statusline chip carries the destination + state; the tooltip and
Info View carry the room, track, and volume.

### Added

- **Sonos speaker chip on the statusline** (`c92eacd0`) — new
  `src/sonos/` subsystem (SOAP / discovery / ops / stream /
  airplay / coreaudio) plus `src/app/sonos.rs`. Cluster next to
  the music chips: one constant-width `[󰓃]` destination chip with
  state carried by color (teal streaming / white playing / dim
  idle). Room / track / volume all live in the hover tooltip +
  Info View, drawn above the strip so nothing shifts. Config
  `[sonos]` (`enabled` / `host` / `room` / `poll_secs` /
  `prefer_airplay` / `chip_label`), `:set sonos` ex-commands,
  Settings **Sonos** section, 16 `sonos.*` palette commands,
  and a full manual page at `site/src/content/docs/manual/sonos.md`.
  Discovery is one SSDP `M-SEARCH` + `GetZoneGroupState`; the
  chip renders nothing when no household answers. All network
  work is on a worker thread behind a Cmd/Snapshot channel pair —
  the render loop never waits on a speaker. Transport goes to
  the group *coordinator*; volume/mute to the named room.
- **Two audio-send paths.** `audio.airplay_music` hands
  Music.app to any AirPlay receiver (Apple TV / HomePod / another
  Mac — no Sonos required) via Music.app's scriptable
  `current AirPlay devices`. For everything else, the
  Sonos-specific loopback stream routes `system output →
  BlackHole → ffmpeg mp3 → mnml HTTP → x-rincon-mp3radio://`,
  restoring your prior default output on stop. `src/sonos/
  coreaudio.rs` is hand-rolled CoreAudio FFI (no `coreaudio-sys`
  dep) for the default-output switch. macOS-only.
- **Pty pane identity strip** (#1133, `52a703c9`) — every Pty
  pane grows a 1-col brand-color strip on its left edge so a
  wall of terminal panes is instantly distinguishable at a
  glance.

### Fixed

- **Ctrl+W on exited Pty pane now actually closes it** (#1131,
  `07e6da95`) — the pane's footer hint has always promised this;
  the exited-Pty key handler was swallowing Ctrl+W. Now it
  closes the pane as advertised.
- **Sonos chip no longer re-flows the statusline on hover**
  (`7e99ee61`) — the right lane is right-aligned, so any width
  change slid every neighbouring chip. Hover expansion is now
  opt-in via `[sonos] chip_label = never | hover | always`
  (default `never`), and even in `hover` mode the expansion
  grows LEFTWARD so a pointer inside the cluster stays inside it.
- **Beatport lime darkened for fg-on-white** (#1138, `818be1ff`)
  — the mixr music-source chip's Beatport branch was unreadable
  against the pale-white idle background. Spotify + Apple were
  left as-is (contrast already OK).
- **Sessions "New session" gutter fixed + mixr idle chip speaker
  color corrected** (#1137 / #1138, `09df5e6a` + `eb89a008`) —
  the initial #1138 fix touched the wrong site (mixr) before the
  follow-up moved it to the sonos idle chip where the real bug
  was; recorded here for archaeology.
- **Pink-on-orange Claude chip** (#1139, `a71352e5`) — the
  em-dash branch of the Claude chip painted pink text on the
  coral background it shares with the numeric branch. Now the
  em-dash branch paints dark-on-coral to match.

### Changed

- **CI: `release-plz-release` job now has `zig` on PATH** (#1128,
  `78a07d50`) + **cargo publish runs with `--allow-dirty`**
  (`a640789f`) so the ghostty-vt build.rs clone doesn't trip the
  release-plz clean-tree check.
- **About page audit fixes** (#1128 tail, `78a07d50`) — stale
  paths + wording sweep across the About surface.

## [0.2.14](https://github.com/chris-mclennan/mnml/compare/mnml-rs-v0.2.13...mnml-rs-v0.2.14) - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- *(ui)* reviewer follow-up on 72f95de0 — gate mixr spacer + narrow tab-strip width
- *(ui)* #1121 tab highlight overhang + #1122 statusline music-chip breather
- *(ci+docs)* release-plz@v0 tag gone + stale post-move header path refs + mixr auth check hardening

## [0.2.13] - 2026-08-19

Marketplace + auto-update polish release. 52 commits over ~10 days
of live-user feedback. Headline: **integrations can now self-update**
on your schedule, with a per-integration opt-in toggle surfaced in
the right-click menu AND on the integration detail page, plus a
`(Current)` marker so the Installed tab tells you at a glance
whether you're on the latest.

### Added

- **Per-integration Auto-update toggle** (#993 / #1088) — right-click
  any integration chip → "Auto-update: ● on / ○ off", or click the
  same toggle on the integration detail page's button strip. Fires
  via `integrations.fire_auto_updates_now` (or the periodic
  planner). Config resolution: per-integration override wins over
  the global `[integrations] auto_update` flag. Each planned update
  opens a visible Pty pane running `cargo install …` + `<name>
  --install` so you can watch the build.
- **`(Current)` version marker** (#1088 addendum) — Installed rows
  render `<version>  (Current)` when up-to-date, `<version> →
  <latest>  [ Update ]` when behind. Integration detail page's
  byline gets the same treatment: `v0.3.17 · by <author>
  (Current)` or `→ v0.3.18 available`.
- **Version + inline Update chip on Installed + Marketplace rows**
  (#1086) — no more hunting for the right-click menu just to see
  which version you have or whether one's out.
- **In-Development marketplace tab** (#1056 / #1087) — config-gated
  `[marketplace] show_dev_tab` opens a fourth tab (glyph U+EEF4
  nf-fa-dev) for authors + testers to see unready siblings without
  polluting the default Marketplace view.
- **Marketplace "Ready" gate** (#1055) — sibling authors declare
  `ready = true` in their manifest to appear in the default
  Marketplace tab. Non-ready siblings only show on the In-Development
  tab, so users never install a WIP integration by accident.
- **⛶ maximize button on pane strips** (#1018) — click to zoom the
  focused pane; click again to restore. Palette: `view.toggle_zoom`.
- **Claude chip sparkline + urgency signal** (#1043) — 8-cell
  spark of usage history + "use this account next" underline
  when quota is imbalanced across multi-account setups.
- **Configurable AI-review templates** (#997) —
  `[ai.review_templates]` config block. Per-user prompts for the
  "Review with Claude / Review with Codex" chips on PR panes so
  you can standardize your team's review rubric.
- **Right-click context menus** on integration chips (#992) —
  "Update to X" / "Show in marketplace" contextual to the
  chip's current state. Editor right-click gains "Explain with
  Claude" / "Ask Claude…" (#980) on any selection.
- **Jira Work `Resolved / Unresolved / All` scope dropdown**
  (#1084) — top-of-tab chip filters Ticket rows by resolution
  state; auto-expand for unresolved tickets fixed at the same time.
- **Jira Work refresh button** (#1053) near the top of the pane.
- **Jira PR row enrichment** (#1051) — merged/open PRs inline with
  action chips (approve / merge / open in browser).
- **Bitbucket PRs + Pipelines lazy fetch** (#1079) — only fetches
  repos with activity in the last 2 weeks by default; "See more"
  link at the bottom pulls the next batch. Cuts 429 pressure on
  workspaces with hundreds of stale repos.
- **`MNML_DATA_ROOT` env override** (#1041) — hermetic sandbox
  for tests + one-off runs. Points every state-file writer at the
  given root instead of `~/Library/Application Support/mnml/`.
- **`MNML_E2E_NETWORK` gate** (#1042) — network-dependent e2e
  tests now opt-in via env var; CI runs without them by default.
- **Timestamped-backup helper** (#1039) — every programmatic TOML
  write (5 sites) now stashes the prior version at `<path>.bak-
  <YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>` before overwriting. Recovery is a `mv`.
- **Startup layout schema** (#878 step 1+2) — `[[startup.layout]]`
  entries declare panes to open at boot. Foundation for the
  broader programmatic-layout track; the resolver is wired but
  the surface is still small.

### Changed

- **Ready badge dropped** from Marketplace rows — every row is
  Ready by definition (unready ones show on In-Development tab
  only), so the badge became redundant noise.
- **Hover-help drag grip** (`═════`) above the panel bottom
  removed (#1089) — was mistaken for a resize handle it wasn't.
- **`mnml-forge-github` moved to In-Development** (#1090) —
  install works but the pane is still Bitbucket-styled port work.

### Fixed

- **LSP completion popup lingering after Tab-accept** (SEV-1
  #1070) — the popup used to hang for 15+ seconds after you
  accepted a ghost-text suggestion. Two-part fix: ghost-accept
  paths clear `app.completion`, and the LSP `Completion` reply
  handler drops the reply outright if a ghost is currently
  showing.
- **Ctrl+W not closing tabs** (#1037 / #1076 reopen) — the prior
  fix was scoped to `Focus::Pane` only, so Claude Usage and
  Coverage panes still ignored it. Now: global top-level intercept
  in Standard input mode.
- **Right-click Uninstall no-op on manifest-only chips** (#1085)
  — ghost `slack.toml` couldn't be removed because the uninstall
  path only walked `integration_icons`, not `integration_manifests`.
- **Coverage delta `±0.0` unreadable** on blue chip (#1080) — grey
  fg on blue bg is invisible; now uses percent-color when delta
  is zero.
- **Stress meter default flipped to off** + persist toggle (#1081)
  — was: reappeared on every restart because toggle didn't hit
  disk.
- **Claude chip reset visibility at 0%** (#1077) — chip showed `⟳Xh`
  reset display only above 0; users tracking "get to 99% by reset"
  couldn't see the target.
- **Slack Channels + Canvases installed without user consent**
  (#1083) — investigated + gated behind explicit install (was
  auto-added by an over-eager first-run path).
- **Slack marked "verified" in Marketplace demo** (#1062) — it's
  WIP, shouldn't have been in the default Ready list.
- **Icon-id → crate-id translation** (#1054) for right-click
  routing — right-click "Update to X" was looking up
  `bitbucket_pull_requests` as a crate name instead of
  `mnml-forge-bitbucket`.
- **`Ctrl+K` Keychain subprocess** threaded out (#913 followup)
  — no more UI freeze on macOS Keychain unlock prompts.
- **CI green** on Ubuntu — `preserves_prior_assignment_across_calls`
  flake fixed; ghost-text.gif was missing from git.

### Merged

- **Various sibling repos** across the marketplace: Jira 0.2.4 →
  0.2.12 (unified assigned view, unresolved filter, actionable
  count chip, QA queue pane), Bitbucket 0.3.7 → 0.3.17 (early-exit
  pagination, `--values` per-repo fix, HTTP-date Retry-After,
  api_token auth, workspace tabs + repos scoping), Slack "Boards" →
  "Canvases" rename.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-08-18

Bug-fix + polish release built from a long session of live-user feedback
(Chris + Liaan). Headline: **SEV-1 leader-chord fix** — bare `<space>`
now opens the NvChad-style whichkey overlay instead of evaporating,
restoring all ~60 `<leader>*` chords declared in the trie.

### Added

- **`theme.auto_system`** — right-click theme chip → "Auto: match
  system (light/dark)" now actually works. One-shot detection:
  macOS `defaults read -g AppleInterfaceStyle`, Linux GNOME
  gsettings + KDE Plasma kreadconfig6/5 fallback, Windows
  `AppsUseLightTheme` registry. Dark → uses `[ui] theme_toggle`
  alt-theme; light → `[ui] theme` default. (#1007)
- **Codex API routing** — first-launch wizard's AI billing pref
  now exposes `Api` for Codex too (not just Sub / Off). Codex CLI
  supports both ChatGPT Plus/Team sub auth and `$OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **Tri-state per-product AI backend routing** — `[ai.routing.claude]`
  / `[ai.routing.codex]` blocks with `Sub / API / Auto / Off` choices,
  wired into the first-launch wizard. `Auto` probes CLI-on-PATH +
  env-key. Ghost-text default flipped to on.
- **Ghost-text via Claude Code sub** — no longer bills against API
  tokens; uses `claude -p` under the hood.

### Changed

- **Empty-state tab bar renders per-tab** — clicking `+` in the
  top-right to create a new desktop tab now shows the empty-state
  bar (left `+` + right split-cluster with Claude / ghostty / H / V)
  same as first-launch. Prior check was `app.panes.is_empty()` which
  only fires on a fresh workspace. (#1019)
- **Tab-page chip spacing tightened** — `1 2 3` instead of the
  looser `1   2   3`. Dropped a padding cell each side. (#1020)
- **Wizard section reorder** — Nerd Font → Input → Claude+Codex
  install → AI billing → AI ghost-text → VSCode shim. Prior order
  asked ghost-text backend first, before install / billing were
  even covered.
- **Statusline chips get pill treatment** — Claude / Codex usage,
  coverage, mixr all render on a distinct `bg_darker` pill so they
  read as grouped chrome.
- **Multi-account Claude ticker** — the usage chip rotates
  through accounts one at a time with a bold-active marker,
  fitting 3+ accounts in the same width.

### Fixed

- **SEV-1: `<space>` opens whichkey via chord-chain fallback** —
  `picker.files` binds `"space f f"` making `<space>` a chord
  prefix. Prior state: pressing `<space>` returned `Pending` with
  no fallback; after the 1s timeout it evaporated. All ~60 leader
  chords silently no-op'd (`<leader>e` fell through to vim as
  end-of-word motion, etc.). Fix: added `"space"` to
  `whichkey.leader`'s keys so `resolve_seq([space])` returns
  `PendingWithFallback(whichkey.leader)`. (#968)
- **Tree-focused Space activates the row** — reviewer follow-up on
  the SEV-1 fix: `pane_wants_bare_space` now includes Tree focus
  in the bypass, so bare Space in the workspace tree reaches the
  documented `tree_activate()` handler instead of getting eaten
  by the chord chain. Leader chords still work from any pane;
  Ctrl+K opens whichkey from the tree. (#968 f/u)
- **Tab-page close-button hitbox** — `bufferline_tab_page_close`
  rect was `width: 1` but painted span was 2 cells. Right half of
  the × was dead. (#1022)
- **Theme detection on KDE** — `detect_system_dark` was GNOME-only
  via gsettings; KDE Plasma users got a false "system light"
  report. Added kreadconfig6 → kreadconfig5 fallback. (#1007 f/u)
- **Per-section hover-help for activity-bar icons** — hovering
  Explorer / Search / Git / Debug / Integrations / Sessions /
  Agents / Cloud Agents / HTTP / Notes / TODOs / Findings all
  previously showed the same generic "one of the sections that
  shares the left panel" placeholder. Each now has a dedicated
  title/body/palette-link entry. (#969)

### Docs

- Removed stale "coming soon" claims from `activity_bar.rs` and
  `ActivitySection` enum docs (all 5 sections ship live content).
  (#1011)
- Site: dropped `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`
  from `astro.config.mjs` — was blocking Google indexing. Added
  `Sitemap:` line to robots.txt.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-08-12

Two flagship features on 8/11 — the **first-launch wizard** and the
**per-integration auth SDK** — plus a big 8/12 add: **L2 demo mode**
(`mnml --demo`), **ghost-text via Claude Code sub**, and a wizard
+ hover-help polish pass driven by user feedback.

### Added

- **First-launch wizard** (`first_launch.show`) — modal that
  auto-opens on first-ever mnml launch, walks new users through
  6 setup questions: AI ghost-text backend (Claude API / Local /
  Skip), input style (vim / standard), Nerd Font check, Claude
  Code + Codex install, VSCode `code` shim, process monitors.
  Install sections spawn a Pty pane running the actual command
  (`npm install -g …`, `sudo ln -sf …`, `brew install …`).
  Esc = "Ask me later"; Enter = "Finish" (persists + suppresses
  future auto-open).
- **Per-integration Settings pane + `[[auth]]` manifest schema.**
  Integration authors declare auth fields (`kind` = secret / text
  / url / email / number, `env_fallback`, `help_url`, `required`)
  via `mnml-bridge 0.7.0`'s new `AuthField`. mnml core drives
  three surfaces from those declarations:
    - **Configure pane**: right-click chip → "Configure…"
      renders a modal form (secrets masked). Ctrl+S writes to
      `[auth_values]` in the same manifest TOML.
    - **First-hit auth guard**: firing a command with a required
      field unset (and no env fallback) opens the Configure pane
      instead of silently spawning a broken Pty.
    - **Pty env-injection**: at spawn time, `[auth_values]` flow
      through as env vars using each field's `env_fallback` name
      — cross-integration, so configuring bitbucket once gives
      jira's Fix Versions view its `$BITBUCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN` for
      free.
- **Pilot siblings** shipped with `[[auth]]`: `mnml-msg-slack
  0.1.3` (bot_token + team_id), `mnml-forge-bitbucket 0.3.3`
  (app_password + username), `mnml-tracker-jira 0.2.3` (site_url
  + email + api_token).
- **`hover-help-writer` agent** (`.claude/agents/`) — audit/fill/
  verify modes over `src/ui/info_view_copy.rs`; enumerates every
  `HoverChip` variant + menu item + tree language, diffs
  against the copy dictionary, reports gaps + drift.
- **`pr-reviewer` agent** — fetches a GitHub PR into an isolated
  worktree, runs cargo build/clippy/test on the branch, stages a
  severity-ranked review at `.mnml/pr-reviews/<N>.md`. Never
  posts to GitHub — user posts after reading.
- **`crates/fim-engine/`** — the local FIM completion engine is
  now a workspace member (was a sibling repo at `../fim-engine/`,
  now vendored via `git subtree` with full history preserved).
  Worktrees under the repo tree work again; no more cross-repo
  coordination.
- **Site manual**: 2 new pages under `site/src/content/docs/manual/`
  — first-launch wizard walkthrough + integration auth deep-dive.
- **L2 demo mode** (`mnml --demo` / `./run.sh demo`). Boots against
  a bundled Notely / Bloom Labs sample workspace (`demo/workspace/`)
  copied to a per-user cache dir + git history seeded from the
  shipped `demo/workspace-git.tar.gz` (fictional 10 commits, 4
  authors, 2 feature branches). Auto-spawns a Python HTTP mock
  server on localhost:7071 that serves 40 JSON fixtures under
  `demo/fixtures/{jira,bitbucket,github}/` — populated Jira
  boards + sprints + tickets, Bitbucket repos + PRs + pipelines,
  GitHub PRs + Actions runs. Env-injects the sibling env vars
  (`JIRA_BASE_URL` etc) so integration panes route through the
  mock. Clears `[[workspaces]]` from the in-memory config so the
  tree rail doesn't leak the user's real workspace favorites.
  Screenshot-ready without exposing real work.
- **AI ghost-text via Claude Code subscription** (`SuggestBackend::
  ClaudeCode`) — reuses the OAuth access token Claude Code caches
  (via `crate::ai_usage::read_claude_token`) so ghost-text calls
  bill against Max/Pro plan quota instead of requiring a separate
  `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Same `/v1/messages` endpoint; `x-api-key`
  header carries the OAuth token (Anthropic 401s Bearer-carried
  OAuth as of early-2026), + `anthropic-beta:
  claude-code-20250219,oauth-2025-04-20` + Claude-Code identity
  system-prompt fragment. Wizard's AI section gains a 4th radio
  ("Claude Code sub — uses your Max/Pro plan") and auto-selects
  it when `claude` CLI + `~/.claude/` are both present. Grey-area
  vs. Anthropic TOS — flagged in the code + docs.
- **`./run.sh demo`** subcommand + interactive-menu entry — mirrors
  `./run.sh` shape (rebuild-on-exit-75 loop). Sets
  `$MNML_DEMO_WORKSPACE` so `./run.sh restart|stop|status` from
  another shell find the running instance's IPC dir at a stable
  path.

### Changed

- **Wizard sections numbered** (1. AI ghost-text / 2. Input style
  / …) with horizontal rules between them — fixes the wall-of-text
  feel; connects with the existing `[1-6] jump section` hint.
- **Wizard input-style row** pre-selects the persisted config value
  but tags the persisted one with `(current)`. `Enter` no longer
  silently overwrites `editor.input_style` — the row must be
  actively cycled (via ←/→/h/l) for the wizard's Finish path to
  persist. Prevents a returning vim user who reopens the wizard
  for the Nerd Font check from losing their vim mode.
- **`hover_tooltip` opt-out** — new `[ui] hover_tooltip` config,
  `view.toggle_hover_tooltip` palette command, `:set
  [no]hovertooltip` ex-command, Settings-overlay row. Info-View
  hover-help covers most surfaces already; the popup was
  annoying users. Off = popup silent, on = original behavior.
- **Wizard AI ghost-text section**: install commands now use
  Anthropic's + OpenAI's official `curl | sh` shell installers
  (`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` +
  `curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh`)
  instead of the outdated npm-global path.
- **Wizard Nerd Font section**: press Space to auto-install
  Symbols Nerd Font Mono (brew / winget / curl per OS) + shows a
  terminal-specific config hint for ghostty / iTerm / Terminal.app
  / WezTerm (font restart warning included).

### Fixed

- **Hover-help panel** 120ms debounce so dragging the mouse across
  tree rows no longer flickers the info-box copy rapid-fire.
  Rapid mouse motion resets a pending timer; content only swaps
  after the fresh target has been stable for the debounce window.
  First paint renders immediately (no lag opening the panel).
- **Wizard headless SEV-1** — portable-choice prompt was covering
  the wizard's first paint in `--headless` because interactive-only
  callers can't dismiss it. Gated `maybe_show_portable_choice_on_launch`
  behind `!args.headless`; headless callers can still choose portable
  via `mnml.choose_data_layout` on the palette.
- **Palette-from-prompt** — Ctrl+Shift+P was consumed by the prompt
  handler when a prompt was open; now dispatches to
  `open_command_palette` first.
- **8 CI-red e2e tests** — space-eating in vim insert / DAP REPL
  / any typed-text surface, plus settings-overlay Esc requiring
  two presses to close and arrow keys not adjusting rows. Root
  cause: R9's `<space>ff` binding made bare space a leader
  prefix. Fix: new `InputHandler::is_op_pending()` trait method
  + broader `pane_wants_bare_space` bypass. 223/223 e2e green.
- **Slack glyph codepoint** — F03EF was NOT slack; the actual
  `nf-md-slack` is U+F04B1. Fixed in `icon_catalog.rs`,
  `marketplace.rs`, installed manifests, AND the msg-slack
  sibling's `install.rs` so future installs write the correct
  codepoint.
- **Hover-help panel** got a 1-row bottom cushion so the last
  content line isn't flush against the statusbar.

### Merged

- **PR #27 from ICodeGorilla** — Windows `zig` target detection
  fix so `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` builds don't silently ABI-
  mismatch to msvc. Approved via the new `pr-reviewer` agent.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-08-09

Re-release of v0.2.9 because the v0.2.9 release workflow scrubbed
the plan output as containing a secret (a stored-secret substring
match on a CHANGELOG phrase) and skipped the entire build matrix
— v0.2.9 shipped with zero binaries. Sanitized the trigger phrase,
plus a small rollup of fixes + one framework addition.

### Fixed

- **Menu-bar Alt+W panic on small terminals.** Window menu is 27
  rows; on a 26-or-shorter terminal the dropdown drew past the
  bottom and panicked in ratatui's Buffer bounds check. Height
  now clamps to screen.
- **Menu-bar Alt+letter for clipped menus was silently broken**
  (initial fix landed as v0.2.9 but the dropdown still bailed
  when the menu chip was clipped). Now paints at a fallback
  origin so keyboard nav works even when the parent chip is
  hidden behind the workspace cluster.
- **Vim Ctrl+O / Ctrl+I stolen by file picker.** The chord
  hijacked the jumplist. Ctrl+O / Ctrl+I now own the vim
  jumplist chord in vim mode; file picker gets Ctrl+Shift+O.
- **`:e file.md` opened MdPreview** instead of the raw editor.
  Ex-command edit paths now route to the raw buffer regardless
  of the config's default markdown-render preference.
- **HTTP panel MOCKS section read a stale in-memory cache** and
  FILES tab surfaced `.mock.json` sidecar files. MOCKS now
  re-reads on refresh; FILES filters `.mock.json` out.
- **Palette ranking now boosts exact-token matches** so a full
  command id wins over a prefix-only hit (`hover-help` no longer
  finds `view.help` first).
- **Browser navigate prompt** — first keystroke now select-all
  replaces the seed URL instead of appending after it.
- **Integration chip color allow-list** rejected white / black
  as "not a color". Both now allowed.
- **CI test flakes on Ubuntu + Windows.** Three tests asserted
  stale hardcoded defaults (integration-glyphs, Claude chip
  color); rewritten to read from the live constant. Fourth
  test (`purge_integration_glyph_state_drops_svg_and_assignment_entry`)
  needed a hermetic HOME+XDG guard so it didn't sniff the CI
  runner's `$HOME/.config/mnml`.

### Added

- **Every runtime UI / editor toggle now persists to user config.**
  Previously toggling workspace dots, wrap, whitespace, rainbow
  brackets, scrollbar, todo highlight, render markdown, sticky
  context, breadcrumb, auto-pair, highlight trailing ws,
  highlight-word, relative numbers, color column, and even the
  vim ↔ standard input style all mutated in-memory config only
  — the toast said "off" but restart reverted to the default.
  New `persist_config_scalar` helper + persist call in every
  `set_*` setter; refactored four inline toggles to the
  `set_ + toggle_` pattern so palette / menu / right-click /
  `:set` all share the same persist path.
- **Marketplace `Reinstall` button** on already-installed
  marketplace entries (previously showed nothing; had to
  uninstall + install).
- **Menu-bar `Toggle bottom panel`** entry under View.
- **Theme chip right-click** now lists all installed themes
  inline instead of opening the picker; also seeds an
  `auto-system` stub (day/night sync with macOS appearance —
  wiring lands in a follow-up).
- **Hover-help info-box separator** at the top of the box
  (dim `───` rule) so it visually detaches from the tree rail
  it shares a background with.
- **Info View v0.3 design doc** in
  `docs/design/info-view-v0.3.md` — the v0.3 flagship: an
  Ableton-style rich hover panel with agent-generated +
  drift-checked copy across ~500 hover targets. Design only,
  not shipped.

### Changed

- **"workspace status dots" → "workspace dots" everywhere.** The
  markers are just visual chips, not status indicators. Palette
  id + config key + ex-command + right-click label all
  consistent now.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-08-09

Same-day rollup on top of v0.2.8 (which was itself the first
cargo-dist success in 9 tag attempts). Two SEV-1 fixes plus a
morning of menu-bar / hover-help / integrations-audit polish.

### Fixed

- **SEV-1: Headers tab typing corrupted the last header value on
  the wire.** `headers_buffer` was rebuilt with no trailing `\n` and
  every reload placed the cursor at end-of-buffer — landing INSIDE
  the last header's value. Any keystroke while Headers was focused
  silently mangled the last header, which is often `Authorization`.
  Auth headers were going out with a corrupted value. Fixed by
  appending a fresh newline to the reload; typing now starts on
  an empty row.
- **SEV-1: `:qa` / `:qall` / `:quitall` silently discarded unsaved
  work.** Vim requires `:qa!` to force. mnml's `:qa` set
  `should_quit = true` unconditionally. Now walks every pane; any
  dirty pane refuses with `unsaved changes — use :qa! to discard`.
  `:qa!` still force-quits.
- **HTTP panel MOCKS section always showed `(0)`.** `walk_for_http`
  only accepted `.http`/`.curl`/`.rest`; sidecar `.mock.json` files
  produced by `:http.save_mock` were structurally invisible to the
  panel. Fixed by walking `**/*.mock.json` alongside.
- **Menu bar Alt+letter for clipped menus was silently broken** —
  the initial fix set `menu_open` but `draw_dropdown` bailed on
  missing `menu_bar_words` entry, creating an invisible input
  trap. The proper fix paints the dropdown at a fallback origin
  (column 0 or after last-visible menu word) so keyboard nav works
  even when the parent chip is clipped by the workspace cluster.
- **Alt+letter no-ops when a picker / prompt / cmdline is open.**
  Prior behavior stacked the menu dropdown on top of the overlay
  and swallowed keys between them.
- **Menu-open + top-level chord (Ctrl+P, F1, etc.) closes the menu
  and runs the chord.** Prior behavior silently no-oped.
- **F10 during a DAP session fires `dap.next`, not the File-menu
  summon.** Menu-summon was unconditionally winning the chord race.
- **Palette exact-phrase substring boost.** Query "hover-help" was
  ranking `view.help` above `view.toggle_hover_help`. Boost pushes
  literal-substring matches above pure fuzzy score.
- **Dirty-quit + clean-quit confirm dialogs default focus to
  `[Cancel]`**, not the destructive middle button. Enter is safe.
- **`palette title` ↔ `menu label` drift** — `view.toggle_tree`
  retitled to "Toggle left panel (file tree · Git · Integrations ·
  Agents · HTTP · Findings)" so palette search matches the menu.

### Added

- **Menu-bar left-column glyphs on every menu** (was only File). File
  / Edit / Selection / View / Go / Run / Terminal / Window / Help
  + Brand each get glyph-prefix icons on rows where a widely-
  recognized Nerd Font glyph matches; 3-space spacer preserves
  alignment where nothing fits.
- **Hover-help repositioned as an Ableton-style info box** at the
  bottom of the left panel — 6-row word-wrapped card with a `? Info`
  header. Replaces the old 1-row footer strip. Tree rows show file
  language (`.tsx` → "TypeScript (JSX)"), Agents-dashboard rows get
  their own description, and focus-target takes precedence over the
  always-active-pane fallback.
- **`view.toggle_workspace_dots` — opt-out for the `● / ○` markers.**
  Config key `[ui] show_workspace_dots` (default `true`), palette
  command, `:set wsdots` / `:set nowsdots` / `:set wsdots!` ex-
  commands, AND a right-click item on any workspace-row context
  menu. Three discovery paths.
- **`integrations.audit_glyphs` diagnostic palette command.** Reports
  three drift classes without repair: (a) manifests whose glyph
  won't render in the user's `~/.config/ghostty/config`
  `font-codepoint-map`, (b) id-alias duplicates in
  `integration-glyphs.toml`, (c) orphan `glyph_meta.toml` entries.
  Writes a full report to `.mnml/findings/glyph-audit-<ts>.md`.
- **id-alias dedupe on manifest merge.** Prevents future recurrence
  of the `amplify` + `mnml-aws-amplify` both-at-F1C0E class of
  ledger drift. Auto-cleans existing dupes on next `integrations.refresh`.

### Changed

- **`view.toggle_bufferline` deleted.** The command + `[ui]
  bufferline` config key + `:set [no]bufferline` ex-arms +
  render-gate + `App::bufferline_visible` field are all gone.
  Investigation showed the toggle only affected the launcher-cluster
  row on the empty welcome screen, and the same cluster also renders
  in the welcome body — so toggling it produced no visible change.
- **Sibling: `mnml-msg-slack v0.1.2` published.** `slack_canvases` →
  `slack_boards` rename (with `PREDECESSOR_IDS` cleanup so upgrading
  users don't end up with 3 chips). Glyph swapped to `\u{F07D2}`
  (mdi-slack, in ghostty's routed range so it renders as the Slack
  logo). Colors: channels = white, boards = yellow.
- **File menu**: `Open recent file (picker)…` row removed (Ctrl+R
  covers keyboard access). `Save all` glyph swapped to a distinct
  double-floppy F0194. Add-folder + switch-workspace + settings +
  quit rows get their own glyphs.
- **View menu**: `Toggle file tree` renamed → `Toggle left panel`
  since the panel hosts Git / Integrations / Agents / HTTP / Findings
  in addition to files.
- **Window menu**: split-right / split-down glyphs match the top-
  right H/V pane-cluster chips (EB56/EB57). Focus-split L/R/U/D get
  matching arrow glyphs. Merge/spread/grow/AI-layout rows all get
  Font-Awesome fallback glyphs (MDI first-picks tofu'd in the user's
  font-codepoint-map).
- **Legacy `family_catalog` install path deleted** (~640 lines).
  CATALOG was `&[]` for months; every entry point was a silent
  no-op. Marketplace is the only install path.
- **Removed dead code**: `AppCommand::CmdlinePopupAcceptCurrentAndCommit`,
  empty `PlaywrightConfig` struct, unreachable `Clone for SpendReportPane`,
  and ~20 archaeology comments referencing subsystems removed months
  ago.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-08-08

First release in eight tags — v0.2.1 through v0.2.7 all had their
tags pushed, but Release-workflow cargo-dist builds silently failed
on the Windows target (unconditional `use std::os::unix::…` in
`src/main.rs` and `src/ai_usage.rs`). Fixed with cfg-gated exec +
secret-file write; the next tag push actually cuts a release.

Rollup of the eight tag arc — see individual commits for detail.

### Added

- **Bake-on-install glyph pipeline (v0.2.0-line finish)** — bridge
  0.5+; each sibling ships its SVG via `ChipSpec::glyph_svg_bytes`,
  mnml bakes into `MnmlSymbols.ttf` at codepoints it owns. Preserves
  user-baked glyphs across rebakes.
- **Auto-refresh Claude OAuth token** — no more "re-link every 8h"
  prompts.
- **Paste into `:` cmdline** — Ctrl+V + bracketed paste route to the
  gutter buffer with control chars stripped.
- **Claude tab thinking spinner** — mnml-owned F1E10..F1E14 frames
  baked at cap-mid, coral brand color.
- **Shared text-input helper** — Ctrl+U/W/K/V + word-nav uniform
  across every text surface.
- **AI usage meter chip** — Claude/Codex quota on the statusline.
- **Verified marketplace chip** — curated allow-list (green ✓ Verified)
  separate from Official/Community authorship.
- **Menu-bar submenus** — `MenuItem::Submenu` variant with hover-open.
- **Left-column glyphs on File menu** (rest of the bar coming next).
- **Findings activity-bar section + `.mnml/findings/*.md` viewer**.
- **Shadow-audit palette command** —
  `integrations.audit_shadowed_binaries` finds stale `mnml-*` in
  `$PATH` ahead of `~/.cargo/bin/`, moves them to a quarantine dir
  so `--install` calls reach the newest binary.

### Changed

- **Marketplace install** uses `cargo install --force` AND explicit
  `$HOME/.cargo/bin/<name> --install` — closes the PATH-shadowing
  loophole where a stale `~/.local/bin/<name>` would win over the
  fresh cargo install and write its old manifest.
- **Tree / integrations chevrons** swapped from Unicode BLACK
  triangles to nf-oct-chevron-right/down (F460/F47C).
- **Findings icon** swapped from `nf-md-magnify_scan` to
  `nf-md-file-search` (F1623).
- **Legacy `family_catalog` install path removed** — CATALOG was
  `&[]` for months; Marketplace is the only install path.
  −680 lines across the delete + audit sweep that followed.
- **Assorted cruft** — dead `AppCommand` variant, empty
  `PlaywrightConfig` struct, unreachable `SpendReportPane` Clone
  impl, dozens of stale archaeology comments.

### Fixed

- **Windows release blocker** (root cause of the eight-tag drought):
  `use std::os::unix::process::CommandExt` in main.rs and
  `use std::io::Write` in ai_usage.rs were unconditional. Cross-
  checked with `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.
- **`bake_ai_glyphs` no longer wipes user-custom glyphs** — the
  bake path now seeds from `glyph_meta.toml` first, adds the
  builtins, preserves everything else.
- **Write-then-chmod race** on `ai_token` + `ai_last_response.json`
  — write with `OpenOptions::mode(0o600)` atomically.
- **Redact-before-write** on `ai_last_response.json` (previously
  wrote raw HTTP body then chmod).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- **Auto-refresh of Claude OAuth token** (`src/ai_usage.rs`). On 401/403
  from the usage endpoint, mnml POSTs the on-disk `refreshToken` to
  Anthropic's OAuth token endpoint, persists the new
  `{accessToken, refreshToken, expiresAt}` blob, and re-issues the fetch.
  Kills the "re-link every 8h" prompt users hit daily.
- **`#RRGGBB` hex literals in `IntegrationIcon.color`** (`src/ui/theme.rs`
  `color_from_slot`). Chips can carry an exact brand color without
  needing a new theme slot. Multi-byte-safe (`get(..)` + `is_char_boundary`
  gate), silent fallback to `t.bg2` on parse failure.
- **Paste into the `:` cmdline** (`src/tui/mod.rs`). Ctrl+V + Cmd+V
  (bracketed-paste) both route into the gutter buffer with control
  chars/newlines stripped.

### Changed
- **Claude Code default color** swapped from the `"orange"` theme slot to
  `"#D97757"` (Anthropic Claude brand orange). Applied consistently to
  installed-list row, palette-bar chip, split-cluster AI chip, and Pty
  tab spinner glyph — the tab glyph forces the coral even when the slot
  lookup misses so the animation always reads as Claude regardless of
  theme drift.
- **Claude spark glyph (F1E00)** SVG swapped to the user-supplied Claude
  Code app-icon path (fixed a relative-move bug that produced a
  "thunderbolt right eye"). Sized 1.55×1.55 with a 0.30 vertical anchor.
- **Pty tab spinner spacing** — 2-char gap after the animated glyph
  (`✳ ✢ ✶ ✻ ✽`) so the dingbat char doesn't sit tight against "Claude Code".
- **Integrations panel refresh chip** — nudged 1 cell inward from the
  panel edge so it isn't jammed against the vertical separator.

### Fixed
- **Built-in chip enabled state reset on restart** (`4bcbb331`). Third
  recurrence — the merge path preserved slot's Rust-default `enabled=false`
  for built-ins, dropping the user's `true` from the authored manifest.
  Gated preservation on `!is_builtin_integration_id`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-03

The v0.2.0 line covers a very large stretch of work — the
Integration SDK (2026-07-03), the federated Marketplace + Provenance
tagging (2026-08), portable-mode infrastructure (`mnml-data/` folder
next to the binary as an alternative to `~/.config/mnml/`; task
#858), layout ops (merge splits→tabs / spread tabs→splits), auto
`.gitignore` of `.mnml/env/*.env`, factory reset with backup, sandbox
mode (`--sandbox`), site-build smoke tests, `libghostty-vt` first-
party bindings, one-tap glyph re-bake, and a lot of persona-tester
polish across the palette, tree, HTTP panel, and rail. See CLAUDE.md's
Status block for the day-by-day trail.

Highlights below are from the initial 2026-07-03 Integration SDK
drop (kept verbatim); the additional 2026-07-04 → 2026-08-03 work
is documented in commit history.

### Added (2026-07-03) — Integration SDK

- **File-based integration manifests** — siblings register their rail
  chip + palette commands + chord bindings + context-menu entries +
  statusline segment + notification policy via a single TOML file at
  `~/.config/mnml/integrations/<id>.toml`. mnml discovers on startup +
  on the new `integrations.refresh` palette command. Precedence:
  workspace > user > built-in defaults; user `[[ui.integration_icon]]`
  in config.toml overrides any manifest (users always win).
- **`mnml-bridge` 0.3.0** — install / uninstall / list_installed
  helpers write the manifest without touching IPC. Full runtime IPC
  helper surface for level-tagged toasts, persistent toasts,
  progress notifications, activity badges, statusline segments, OS
  notifications. See [Bridge / Mount protocol](/manual/bridge-mount/).
- **Level-tagged toasts** — `App::toast_info` / `toast_warn` /
  `toast_error`. Per current design: info + warn share the standard
  comment border (calm ambient state); error gets a red border so
  actual failures stand out. Wire supports the level flip if you
  want all three colored later.
- **Persistent toasts** — `toast_persistent(id, msg, level)` pins
  until an explicit `toast_dismiss(id)`. Rendered above the
  ephemeral toast stack; repeat calls with the same id update in
  place.
- **Progress notifications** — `progress_start` / `progress_update`
  / `progress_end`. Animated Braille spinner + label + optional %.
  Terminal-status glyph on end (✓ / ✗ / ⊘) that lingers ~2.5s
  before auto-removal. Failed status also fires `toast_error(label)`.
- **Dynamic statusline segments** — `statusline_set_segment(...)`
  with a hybrid packing model (priority desc, allocate max_width
  while budget allows, drop when below min_width). Left- and
  right-lane segments compete separately for their half of the
  statusline. Losing a sibling segment beats losing canonical state
  (line/col, workspace, language).
- **OS notifications** — `notify(title, body, opts)` fires the
  terminal-native OSC 9 + OSC 777 escape sequences. Ghostty / iTerm2
  / kitty / WezTerm / Windows Terminal route to native OS banners.
  Per-integration policy from the manifest `[notifications]` block:
  `os_notify_on = never | error_only | always` and
  `os_rate_limit_sec`. Terminal-focus suppression deferred to the
  terminal (Ghostty already respects DND).
- **`[jira]` config** — `domain` + `ticket_prefix` fields, with
  `MNML_JIRA_DOMAIN` and `MNML_JIRA_TICKET_PREFIX` env overrides.
  Used to build ticket URLs + validate ticket ids in the ECS
  runner trigger. Empty = feature no-op.
- **`[cloud_agents]` config** — full ECS runner infrastructure
  fields (region, account_id, runs_table, cluster, task_definition,
  sg_export_name, log_group, s3_artifacts_bucket, aws_profile_fallback,
  label, short_id, default_workspace_label). Feature no-ops when
  `region` or `runs_table` is empty. Env overrides for
  `MNML_CLOUD_AGENTS_REGION` and `MNML_AWS_PROFILE`. See
  [Cloud agents runner](/manual/cloud-agents-config/).

### Changed (2026-07-03)

- **`tattle_qwe` → `ecs_runner`** — the AWS Fargate cloud-agent
  runner is now a generic config-driven feature instead of
  Tattle-specific infra hardcoded in source. `AgentSource::TattleQwe`
  → `AgentSource::Ecs` (and matching `CloudRunSource` / `CloudRunner`
  renames). Wizard label reads from config; falls back to
  `"ECS runner"`. Hardcoded AWS account id + `tattle.atlassian.net`
  domain + `tattle-claude-artifacts` bucket + all AWS resource
  names moved to `[cloud_agents]` config. Existing users need to
  populate the config section to keep the feature working.
- **`is_valid_ticket` accepts any `[A-Z]+-\d+`** by default —
  supply a `[jira] ticket_prefix` to constrain to your org's
  canonical prefix. Was hardcoded to `TE-` before.

### Removed (2026-07-03)

- **Private Tattle Inbox surface** — `forge.open_tattle_inbox`
  palette command, `<leader>it` chord binding, and default
  `tattle_inbox` IntegrationIcon. Superseded by the Integration
  SDK: the sibling's own `--install` writes a manifest at
  `~/.config/mnml/integrations/tattle_inbox.toml` and mnml picks
  it up. No mnml-core-shipped mentions of Tattle Inbox anymore.
- **`Category::Tattle` + `tattle_tests` catalog entry** — last
  private-catalog entry removed. `FamilySibling::is_private()` kept
  as an API hook (returns false).

### Added (2026-06-29)

- **Right panel v5 polish** — `Ctrl+Alt+W` closes the active tab from the
  keyboard (`view.right_panel_close_tab`); tab right-click menus gain
  **Close other tabs** and **Close all tabs** (when ≥2 tabs); right-clicking
  the `×` button opens the same context menu as the active tab; the `×`
  paints two visually distinct states — `bg2` bridge when the active tab is
  rightmost (so the `×` reads as its close button), `bg_dark` + `comment`
  styling when not (so it reads as "acts on the active tab, not this
  chip"); empty-state hint lists all five routable commands clickably
  (`:outline.show`, `:lsp.diagnostics`, `:ai.chat`, `:find.grep`,
  `:test.run`); header now reads lowercase `right panel`.
- **Right panel chip short forms** — when the per-chip budget would
  truncate past the live count / status glyph, the tab label falls back
  to a short form that keeps the information that matters:
  Diagnostics → `✗N⚠M`, Tests → `✓N` / `✗N` / `…`, Grep → `q… N` (or
  `(N)` at the tightest), AI → `AI ✦` (or just the marker), Outline →
  file stem.
- **HTTP `###` block navigation** — `<leader>h]` / `:http.next_block`
  and `<leader>h[` / `:http.prev_block` jump the cursor between blocks
  in multi-block `.http` / `.rest` files. Wraps at EOF/BOF; viewport
  reveals the cursor if it lands offscreen.
- **HTTP `[http] default_env` config key** — set a sticky default env
  per-workspace (`<workspace>/.mnml/config.toml`) or user-global
  (`~/.config/mnml/config.toml`). Resolution chain is now
  `--env` → `$MNML_ENV` → `[http] default_env` → `.rqst/config`.
- **HTTP history headers + body preserved** — every `http.send` entry
  now persists the request headers and body in addition to method / URL
  / status / duration. Re-firing from `:http.history` reconstructs a
  complete curl (`-X`, every `-H`, `--data-raw`) instead of the
  method+URL-only minimal form. Older entries still re-fire as the
  minimal form.
- **Lookup scan is recursive** — `:http.lookup`'s file picker now walks
  subdirectories under `.rqst/lookups/` (the prior flat read_dir
  silently missed nested files). Skips `target`, `node_modules`, and
  dotfile entries. All three extensions (`.curl` / `.http` / `.rest`)
  picked up by the same walker.
- **Per-block mock sidecars** — multi-block `.http` files now save one
  `.mock.json` per `### named` block:
  `requests.<block-name>.http.mock.json`. Unnamed leading blocks fall
  back to the bare sibling path (`requests.http.mock.json`); single-
  block `.http` save still falls through to whole-file overwrite. The
  prior shared-sidecar shape silently overwrote block A's mock when
  block B was saved.
- **Vim operator inclusivity** — `de` / `ye` / `ce` now include the
  destination character (vim's `:help inclusive`). `d$` / `y$` / `c$`
  include the last char of the line. `cw` / `cW` are remapped to `ce`
  / `cE` (vim canon: change-word excludes trailing whitespace).
- **Vim `Ctrl+R Ctrl+W` / `Ctrl+R Ctrl+A` in INSERT** — insert the
  identifier (or full WORD) under the cursor at the caret. Both chords
  are checked before the lowercase-letter register-paste arm, so
  `Ctrl+R W` no longer disappears into a `"w` register read.
- **Vim `Ctrl+Shift+[` / `Ctrl+Shift+]` in NORMAL** — fold / unfold
  chords reach the editor instead of being eaten by the vim bracket
  prefix. The bracket prefix now guards on `!ctrl` so only the bare
  brackets feed `[c` / `]c` (git hunks) and `[d` / `]d` (diagnostics).
- **Spend report runs on a background thread** — `:ai.spend_today`
  opens the pane immediately with `loading = true`; the JSONL scan
  runs in a worker; `App::tick` polls the mpsc channel and swaps the
  snapshot in when the worker drains. Title bar shows
  `· computing…` while pending. Totals toast fires from the drain
  path (was unreachable inline). `r` (refresh) and pane `Drop` set a
  cooperative `Arc<AtomicBool>` abort flag — the worker stops at the
  next per-file check, within a few hundred ms.
- **`Ctrl+P` workspace affinity** — file-picker items carry a
  `PickerItem.priority` field; `refilter` sorts
  `(priority desc, score desc, index asc)`. Current-workspace files
  (priority 2) outrank cross-workspace recents (priority 1) and
  extra-workspace tree entries (priority 0) regardless of fuzzy
  score. Fixes a regression where a shorter cross-workspace label
  (`lib.rs`) beat a longer current-workspace path (`src/lib.rs`)
  even when the user typed the longer pattern.

### Added (2026-06-28)

- **Right side panel** — a collapsible panel on the right editor edge. Toggle
  with `Ctrl+Shift+B`, the EC00 icon in the palette bar, or `:set rightpanel` /
  `:set rp!`. Drag the left-edge grip to resize. Visible state and width persist
  via `session.json`; config defaults: `[ui] right_panel_visible` and
  `[ui] right_panel_width`. Palette command `view.toggle_right_panel`; which-key
  chord `<leader>tr`. Settings overlay gains two new rows (visible + width).
- **Integration `enabled` opt-in** — every integration chip now carries an
  `enabled` flag. Only `browser` is enabled by default. Right-click a chip →
  Enable / Disable; the change is persisted back to TOML. Disabled chips render
  dim and don't fire on click. New palette commands: `integrations.toggle_enabled`,
  `integrations.edit`, `integrations.remove`.
- **External tool launchers** — `tools.htop` / `tools.iftop` / `tools.btop`
  (also `term.htop` / `term.iftop` / `term.btop` aliases) probe `$PATH` and
  open the tool in a Pty pane, or fire a platform-aware install-hint toast
  (Homebrew / apt / winget). Which-key chord `<leader>...b` (btop).
- **Icon picker** — `integrations.icon_picker` (`<leader>ip`) opens a ~70-glyph
  Nerd Font browser organised by category. Accepting a glyph copies the character
  and its `\u{XXXX}` escape to the clipboard.
- **Pty panes in bufferline** — terminal and Claude Code sessions get bufferline
  tabs with a `$` suffix and a close button. `:bn` / `:bp` skip Pty tabs.
- **Palette bar redesign** — sidebar toggle + right-panel toggle + flat
  integration chips in the workspace-to-right-cluster gap + add-integration `+`
  (EA7C codicon). Compact-mode right cluster drops TABS instead of vanishing at
  narrow widths.
- **Drag-to-split improvements** — orphan-pane recovery when the source pane is
  alone in its leaf; rect-clear architecture fixes multiple stale-rect bugs.
- **Hover and right-click coverage** — every palette-bar chip now has a tooltip
  (hover for description) and a context menu (right-click for actions).
- **Right panel v2** — when the panel is visible, `outline.show` and
  `lsp.diagnostics` host inside it instead of splitting the editor body.
  Header switches between OUTLINE / DIAGNOSTICS based on hosted-pane kind, and
  a `×` button on the header evicts the hosted pane (panel stays open, returns
  to the empty-state copy). Below 16 cells the body shows "too narrow — drag
  edge wider" instead of cramped pane content. Empty-state copy now teaches
  the two commands.
- **Shift+F10 opens the context menu for the focused element** — keyboard
  equivalent of right-click. Routes Focus::Tree → tree-row menu, Focus::Pane
  → bufferline tab menu, and falls back to the cursor's most-recent
  `hover_chip` (integration / launcher / gear menus). Palette command
  `view.context_menu_at_focus`. VS Code + macOS convention.
- **Chord-chain leader-letter fix** — in standard input mode the chord chain
  was eating the first leader letter when its fallback opened whichkey, so
  `<leader>tr` required `Ctrl+K t t r` instead of `Ctrl+K t r`. Now the
  opener letter is fed to the just-opened whichkey overlay.
- **`Ctrl+N` in vim INSERT** reaches the keyword-completion handler
  (`editor.keyword_complete`) instead of being stolen by the global
  `file.new` chord. `Ctrl+P` stays bound globally (palette / recents).
- **`:set rightpanel` vim semantics** — `:set rightpanel` enables (idempotent),
  `:set rightpanel!` toggles, `:set norightpanel` disables. Matches `:set
  invrightpanel` for the bang-equivalent.

### Refactored (2026-06-28 evening)

- **9-step file split** — `src/app/mod.rs` shrank from 14,234 → ~11,500 lines
  and `src/tui.rs` from 7,712 → ~1,700 lines. New siblings:
  `src/app/{util,sibling_install_methods,workspace_methods,cloud_agents_methods,cmdline_methods}.rs`
  and `src/tui/{chord,mouse}.rs` plus `src/tui/handlers/{overlay,pane}.rs`.
  Pure non-destructive — every function kept its signature; some private fns
  elevated to `pub(crate)`. 977 → 980 tests pass; verified by a post-split
  regression sweep (0 issues).

### Fixed (2026-06-28)

- `run.sh` and `dev.sh` prepend `/opt/homebrew/opt/zig@0.15/bin` to PATH so
  `libghostty-vt-sys`'s build.rs doesn't silently fail on macOS shells that
  don't have zig in PATH. Without this, `./run.sh restart` would loop on a
  stale binary while appearing to rebuild.

### Removed (2026-06-22)

- **Tmnl integration removed.** Mnml is now terminal-agnostic. Pivoted to
  "mnml runs in any terminal; let the terminal handle rendering quality."
  - `Pane::BlitHost` + the entire blit-protocol client; `mixr_host`,
    `pane_host`, `chrome_chips` modules.
  - `--blit`, `--no-native-promote` CLI flags; `TMNL_TRANSFER_SOCKET`
    auto-promote-to-tmnl-native-tab path; `MNML_BLIT_SOCKET` env var.
  - `:host.launch`, `:tmnl.open-tab`, `:tmnl.pop-pty` ex commands;
    `tmnl.*` palette commands.
  - `tmnl-protocol` Cargo dependency.
- Reset default integration icons from `:host.launch <bin>` to `:term <bin>`
  (sibling tools open as Pty panes now).

### Added (replacing removed behaviour)

- `mixr.show` palette command + `App::open_mixr` — opens mixr as a
  Pty pane (replaces the prior `mixr_host` docked panel).

mnml has not yet had a tagged release. The `0.1.0` line below summarises the
capabilities present in the current `main`.

### Added (2026-06-06) — integration discovery overlay + folder browser

- **`+` "Add integration" discovery overlay** — a `+` chip on the sidebar's
  INTEGRATIONS header (and the palette command `integrations.add`) opens a
  centered overlay listing the full family catalog (15 hardcoded siblings,
  grouped by category: AWS, Databases, Forges, Trackers, Filesystems, Test
  runners). Per-row status: ✓ in rail (green) / ✓ installed (cyan) / ✗ not
  installed (red). Keys: `↑↓`/`jk` move, `Enter` adds to rail, `i` spawns
  a `cargo install` Pty pane live, `y` yanks the install command, `Esc`
  closes. New modules: `src/family_catalog.rs`, `src/app/discovery.rs`,
  `src/ui/discovery_overlay.rs`.
- **Pty install from overlay** — pressing `i` on a not-installed row runs
  `cargo install --git <repo> --tag <ver> <binary>` in a live Pty pane; the
  overlay closes so the pane gets the screen. Re-opening the overlay after
  install picks up the new state (detection cache cleared on open). No-op
  for auto-discovered entries (repo URL unknown).
- **TOML write-back persistence** — `Enter` to add a sibling to the rail now
  also rewrites the `[[ui.integration_icon]]` section of
  `~/.config/mnml/config.toml` via a line-based strip-and-rewrite. Other
  sections, comments, and whitespace are preserved. Idempotent across
  multiple opens/adds. Toast reports the config path on success or an error
  on failure.
- **Auto-discovery of community siblings** — the `+` overlay also surfaces
  any `mnml-<class>-<name>` binary found on `$PATH` or well-known dirs that
  is not in the hardcoded catalog. Category is derived from the class prefix;
  icon uses a cog glyph with a category-appropriate color. These rows render
  with a `· auto-discovered` chip in the status column. `i` and `y` are
  no-ops (repo URL unknown); `Enter` to add to rail works normally.
- **Folder browser for "Open folder…" prompt** — the `AddWorkspace` prompt
  now shows a live-filtered directory listing below the input (capped at 12
  suggestions). `↑↓` navigate rows, `Tab` autocompletes from the focused row,
  `Enter` accepts the focused row or the typed input. Tilde expansion, dotfile
  skip unless prefix asks, case-insensitive prefix match. Other prompt kinds
  (`GitCommit`, `Find`, etc.) are unchanged — controlled by the new
  `is_path_kind()` predicate on `Prompt`.

### Added (2026-06-06)

- **Three new blit-host integration icons** — `cloudwatch_logs`, `amplify`,
  and `dynamodb` added to the default `integration_icons` list in `src/config.rs`.
  Each icon in the file-tree rail launches its sibling binary on click:
  - `cloudwatch_logs` → `:host.launch mnml-aws-cloudwatch-logs` (live log-stream
    tail viewer; per-tab filter patterns)
  - `amplify` → `:host.launch mnml-aws-amplify` (Amplify apps / branches /
    deploy-jobs; `apps` and `app` tab kinds)
  - `dynamodb` → `:host.launch mnml-db-dynamodb` (DynamoDB table browser; smart
    PRIMARY column auto-resolved via `describe-table`)
- **Three new palette commands** — `forge.open_cloudwatch_logs`,
  `forge.open_amplify`, `forge.open_dynamodb` (group `forge`); accessible from
  the command palette and bindable as keychords.
- **Three new which-key chords** under `<leader>i` (`+integrations`): `w` →
  CloudWatch Logs viewer, `a` → AWS Amplify viewer, `d` → DynamoDB browser.

### Added (2026-06-06) — Lambda + EventBridge

- **Two new blit-host integration icons** — `lambda` (nf-md-lambda, orange,
  `:host.launch mnml-aws-lambda`) and `eventbridge` (nf-md-bus, pink,
  `:host.launch mnml-aws-eventbridge`) added to the default
  `integration_icons` list in `src/config.rs`.
- **Two new palette commands** — `forge.open_lambda` and
  `forge.open_eventbridge` (group `forge`).
- **Two new which-key chords** under `<leader>i` (`+integrations`): `L` →
  AWS Lambda browser (capital, because lowercase `l` is GitLab), `e` →
  EventBridge buses + rules browser.
- **Two new Manual pages** — `site/src/content/docs/manual/integrations/
  aws-lambda.md` and `aws-eventbridge.md`.
- **First cross-sibling handoff** — Lambda's `L` chord also launches
  `mnml-aws-cloudwatch-logs`; v0.2 will auto-scope to the function's log
  group.

### Fixed (2026-06-06)

- **Which-key `+integrations` was unreachable** — `'i'` was double-registered
  at the root trie with both `+integrations` and `+insert`; `BTreeMap` dedup
  silently dropped `+integrations`. Fixed by moving `+insert` to capital `'I'`.
  Regression test added (`integrations_group_is_reachable`).

### Added (2026-06-02)

- **Startup workspace picker** (`#76`) — `--startup-picker` CLI flag (or
  `MNML_STARTUP_PICKER=1` env var) shows a JetBrains-style chooser on launch:
  [1] New file (current workspace), [2] Open file… (`view.discovery`), [3–9]
  configured `[[workspaces]]` rows. Keys: `↑↓`/`jk` move, `Enter` commit,
  `1`–`9` direct jump, `Esc`/`q` skip. The `mnml.app` and `mnml-nightly.app`
  launchers export `TMNL_LAUNCH_ARGS="--input standard --startup-picker"` so
  clicking the icon from Finder lands on the chooser instead of `$HOME`.
  New modules: `src/app/startup_picker.rs`, `src/ui/startup_picker.rs`.
- **Update-available check** (`#77`) — on launch (skipped in headless/blit
  modes; opt-out via `[ui] check_updates = false`), a background std thread
  GETs `api.github.com/repos/chris-mclennan/mnml/releases/latest`, parses
  `tag_name`, and compares it to `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`. When a newer tag is
  found, `App::tick` fires a one-shot toast with the release URL. New module:
  `src/update_check.rs`.
- **Nightly app bundle** (`#78`) — `./scripts/build-app.sh --nightly` produces
  `target/mnml-nightly.app` with bundle ID `sh.mnml.app.nightly`. Coexists
  with the stable bundle in `/Applications`. The nightly launcher always execs
  `~/Projects/mnml/target/release/mnml` (latest local `cargo build --release`)
  rather than shipping a bundled binary. Icon: blue background + charcoal
  wordmark (stable is the inverse).

### Changed (2026-06-02)

- **`build-app.sh` improvements** — stamps `CFBundleVersion` with a per-build
  timestamp so Finder picks up icon/launcher changes without `killall Dock`.
  Strips icon transparent margin to avoid macOS Tahoe's glass-template grey
  bezel. Bumps `LSMinimumSystemVersion` from `10.14` to `11.0` (removes the
  misleading Tahoe "Support Ending for Intel-based Apps" warning that triggers
  on any pre-Big-Sur app). Hardens `scripts/launcher.sh`: no `set -eu` + zshrc
  sourcing; explicit static PATH; falls back to
  `/Applications/tmnl.app/Contents/MacOS/tmnl` when no CLI symlink is present.

### Added (2026-05-24)

- **Blit-host integration** (`Pane::BlitHost`) — `:host.launch <binary> [args…]`
  spawns an out-of-process binary and renders its output into a pane over a Unix
  socket using the `tmnl-protocol` wire format. Key events forward through;
  `Ctrl+E` releases focus. Protocol contract documented in `docs/PLUGINS.md`.
- **Settings overlay** — `:settings` / `view.settings` opens a keyboard-driven
  schema editor for everyday config toggles. Section headers, `▸ row` focus, `*`
  modified marker. Keys: `←→` adjust, `↑↓` move, `r` reset row, `R` reset all,
  `Enter` save, `Esc` cancel.
- **Config-driven launcher-icon strip** — `[[ui.launcher_icon]]` TOML entries
  drive the bufferline right-cluster. Fields: `id`, `glyph`, `fallback`,
  `command`, `color`, `tooltip`. `command` accepts a registered command id or a
  `:host.launch …` ex-string. Setting the key replaces the built-in
  Claude Code + Codex defaults.
- **tmnl tab hand-off** — `:tmnl.open-tab <command>` (alias `:tmnl.tab`),
  palette commands `tmnl.open_claude_in_tab` / `tmnl.open_codex_in_tab`: when
  mnml is hosted under tmnl, asks tmnl to spawn the command as a new native tab.
  No-ops with a toast otherwise.
- **pty fd hand-off** — `:tmnl.pop-pty` (alias `:tmnl.pop`, palette
  `tmnl.pop_pty`): transfers the focused terminal pane's pty master fd to tmnl
  via SCM_RIGHTS, turning it into a sibling native tab without killing the child.
  Unix only.
- **`aws-codebuild` Cargo feature** — `Pane::CodeBuilds` (recent-builds browser)
  and `Pane::LogTail` (CloudWatch log tail) moved out of a private feature into
  a generic `aws-codebuild` feature. Shells out to the `aws` CLI; no new crate
  dependencies. Off by default.
- **`run.sh` family subcommands** — `build`, `release`, `test`, `check`, `watch`,
  `help` (dev wrappers), plus `blit <socket>` (run as tmnl native client) and
  `under-tmnl [WS]` (launch tmnl with mnml as a native tab).

### Removed (2026-05-24)

- **Private workspace-integration Cargo feature** — stripped from the public
  crate. AWS-generic code moved to `src/app/aws.rs` under `aws-codebuild`. The
  removed integration is rebuilt as an out-of-process blit-host binary (see
  `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` for the pattern).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- macOS `.dmg` artifact now ships with cargo-dist's standard naming
  (`mnml-rs-<triple>.dmg`).
- Install page's macOS download button points at the DMG (drag-to-install).
- Smaller fixes (release pipeline cleanup).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- First `.app` bundle + DMG artifacts shipping with releases.
- Refactor: `build-app.sh` / `build-dmg.sh` accept `--bin-path` so CI can
  package the cargo-dist-built binary directly.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- **Pluggable input layer** — a modal vim keymap and a modeless standard keymap,
  both fully remappable and swappable at runtime.
- **Panes & layout** — a recursive split tree, vim `Ctrl-W` window chords,
  vim-style tab pages, a bufferline, and session restore.
- **Language intelligence** — a config-driven LSP client: completion, hover,
  go-to-definition, references, rename, code actions, diagnostics, inlay hints,
  semantic tokens, hierarchies, signature help, folding, and an Outline pane.
- **Git** — gutter signs, a diff pane with per-hunk staging, a staging view, a
  coloured-lane commit graph, a branch/worktree/PR rail, blame, sync
  operations, and AI-written commit messages.
- **SCM & CI dashboards** — pipelines / builds and pull requests across
  Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps.
- **AI** — embedded `claude` CLI / Codex panes, on-selection explain / fix /
  refactor / write-tests actions, Copilot-style inline suggestions (API or a
  local FIM backend), and AI commit messages.
- **HTTP client** — `.http` / `.curl` / `.rest` request files, request chains,
  OpenAPI stub discovery, and an editable request pane.
- **Browser & CDP** — a Chrome DevTools Protocol browser pane with network, DOM,
  cookie, storage, and performance inspectors, screenshots, and PDF export.
- **Debugging** — a Debug Adapter Protocol client with breakpoints, stepping, a
  variables tree, watches, and a REPL.
- **Testing** — a Playwright runner with a trace viewer and flaky-test
  dashboard, and a line-based `.test` end-to-end format.
- **UI** — 94 NvChad base46 themes, tree-sitter highlighting for 39+ languages
  with injection, a which-key leader popup, markdown preview, inline image
  rendering, and a fuzzy command palette / file finder.
- **Headless mode** — `mnml --headless` driven over a file-IPC channel, plus an
  out-of-process plugin surface.
